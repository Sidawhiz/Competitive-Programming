Subsequence , Substring standard DP problems and there variations

Problems here generally can be solved by these techniques :
a) Prefix based subproblems : X[:i]
b) Suffix based subproblems : X[i:]
   Both of these techniques take O(n)*O(#subproblems)
   
c) Substring based subproblems : X[i:j]
   This technique takes O(n^2)*O(#subproblems)
   Mainly used in MATRIX based questions
